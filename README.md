# ViolentMonkey User Scripts

A small collection of userscripts for ViolentMonkey, mainly focused on blocking distractions and tweaking web UIs to my liking.

## Scripts 👩‍💻

- **[TikTok Blocker](https://github.com/quydev-fs/ViolentMonkeyUserScripts/blob/main/tiktok/tiktok-blocker.user.js)**  
  Completely blocks TikTok before its JavaScript even starts running.

- **[YouTube Shorts Hider (Mobile)](https://github.com/quydev-fs/ViolentMonkeyUserScripts/blob/main/youtube/short-blocker-mobile.user.js)**  
  Hides YouTube Shorts elements on the mobile web interface.

- **[GooBox](https://github.com/quydev-fs/ViolentMonkeyUserScripts/blob/main/google/Gruvboxize.user.js)**  
  Applies a Gruvbox-inspired theme to Google Search.

## Notes ⚠️

- **GooBox** targets Google Search, which uses heavily obfuscated and frequently changing markup.  
  Expect occasional breakage when Google updates their frontend. This is normal and unavoidable.

- These scripts are written for personal use first.  
  Feel free to fork, modify, or adapt them to your own needs.
